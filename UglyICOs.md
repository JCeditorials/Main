# JC's Guide to Identifying Ugly ICOs

People come up with all kinds interesting things.  Really, the more innovative human beings become, the more regulation we have (eventually) and the more evident it becomes that most people are just not that creative.  The latest and greatest seems to be "\[some-search-engine-optimized-word\] blockchain" = next ICO.  It's so formulaic!  "Awesome" blockchain.  "World Peace" blockchain.  The most interesting part is that quite often the people who are leading these endeavors don't even realize it's "Money-Laundering Method #2855" blockchain ... until a blockchain developer is being walked through how they want the technology to be set up and firmly-but-gently encourages them to run the operation by legal counsel.  If the people who are standing up these ICOs don't even know it's money-laundering (which could include intent to engage in tax evasion or knowledge that the transaction was designed to avoid a transaction reporting requirement, etc. but-I'm-not-a-lawyer...), how would the average "Main Street" investor?

After spending countless hours studying a wide range of ICO white papers, their websites, and anything else these ICOs have to offer by way of "information", I have come to a place where I have become extremely skeptical as to the merits of the vast majority of these projects.  If you are interested in what I've found and why I've become so jaded, read on.

Disclaimer 1: I am not a financial advisor.  More importantly, I'm not your financial advisor.  
Disclaimer 2: I have no authority to determine the legal status of anything, especially ICOs.  
Disclaimer 3: Yes, I've made more than I've lost on cryptocurrency "investments".  

In most cases, there is not a compelling business reason to require huge amounts of cash up front to make these projects a reality.  ICOs disappear faster than they appear (and they appear pretty darn quickly!) so I believe it to be their burden to convince us potential investors that both the team and project will stick around.  No fancy algorithm is going to help a company weather the stormy ebbs and flows of a market that will demand real, substantive, and substantial contributions to societal advancement in the long term.

As a potential investor, you will either want to put your money toward the greater cause of research and development without expecting anything back, or you will want to put your money toward something that will become an excellent product.
- In the former, the team putting together the ICO should be honest and clear about why they are the better team and why they need to perform this research independently of other teams already doing similar things as my first inclination would be to ask "why are you not trying to get along with the more established teams that invented this stuff and are offering grants at the moment?"  This also means they should not be emphasizing a product or set of products that imply that you can expect a return on your investment.
- In the latter, the team putting together the ICO should have a pitch deck reminiscent of startup pitch decks (containing market research with leading indicator data, etc.) while making a clear case for why an ICO is needed (not just preferred) as opposed to asking angel investors and venture capitalists.  If traditional investors are already passing up this opportunity, it certainly makes me think twice.  Even startups have to make a clear case for why they need angel investments and venture capital as opposed to just putting the good idea together (bank loan or not) and obtaining vendors in the more traditional small business way.

By the way, I fail to see how putting a cap on the ICO is substantially more responsible than not capping the ICO.  I tend to see this as purely a PR scheme.  It's like saying, "we're not as bad as those other guys because we found it morally reprehensible to run away with anything in excess of this particular amount."  Yes, call me cynical.

## Overall

#### Red Flags:
- Key information is inconsistent across available publications.
- "Proprietary" methods and background algorithms that are not explained.

#### Yellow Flags:
- Emphasis on what **could** be done and what the team would **like** to do vs. what they **are** doing and just need extra funding to finish.
- Proposed business model attempts to solve for too many business cases.  It's fun to go crazy about where things can lead, but if it's not clear what will be focused on and prioritized to establish a solid foundation for those future technologies, the team is already operating in a scattered and inefficient, likely ineffective manner.
- Proposed business model fails to consider major practical aspects of the industry they want to create technology for.

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- Everything has its proper place without too much repetition, indicating the team that put together the presentation was thoughtful about where each item belonged.

## White Paper

#### Red Flags:
- White paper is not prominent or easily accessible through the website.
- White paper does not contain any technical content.
- There is no technical white paper available.
- The technical white paper is not sufficiently technical (i.e. does not contain technical specifications, technical designs, and/or code snippets) which indicates they haven't thought it through sufficiently yet and are asking for money too early.

#### Yellow Flags:
- White paper contains technical content, but struggles to clearly explain how the proposed technology solves the problem(s).

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- Technical white paper contains code.  (This indicates they have already begun work, not just wanting to get started.)

## Marketing

#### Red Flags:
- Overdoing it with above-board claims.

#### Yellow Flags:
- Trying to scare away competition with gimmicks (e.g. "patent pending" without offering a provisional patent number for ease of verification to clarify which piece of technology is patented ... which, by the way, is not a guarantee that the patent being applied for will be granted, especially if it is overly broad).

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- 

## Legal

#### Red Flags:
- No disclaimers.
- Unreasonable overuse of disclaimers (i.e. disclaiming things they had promised earlier, especially if it is their USP).

#### Yellow Flags:
- General overuse of disclaimers (i.e. disclaiming things they should actually be promising).
- Explaining more of what they are not than what they are (e.g. this is not a prospectus, this is not a security, this is not an investment, there is no expected ROI, etc.).  What could be better is setting clear boundaries with regard to what their responsibilities are, what your responsibilities would be, and why they chose to draw the lines that way.

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- In cases where the team is unsure of where things stand (as is often the case with nascent industries), offering a detailed explanation of the current legislation with citations to demonstrate the level of due diligence they have performed and are willing to share with you.  Also, it demonstrates they are embracing their responsibilities in keeping everyone on the up-and-up.  I read one that went so far as to say that there are a couple of bills making their way through the legislative branches of their state and how they want to position the project if the bills pass or fail.  That raised the bar for me, big time.

## Team

#### Red Flags:
- Lack of adequate team members or no team members at all.  The "we need capital to hire people later" is very unrealistic.  Firstly, it doesn't require currency to network and line up the team.  Consider it an investment of time the team should make in advance of the token sale since they would need to spend the same amount of time afterward to get to the same spot.  Secondly, the demand for qualified personnel is high and the supply is extremely low right now (as I sit here in 2018Q1).  If by persuasion leadership hasn't secured the buy-in of the people they need for the project yet, they would be hard pressed to make efficient use of capital after the token sale to lock in a team they haven't spoken to or met previously.
- Lack of corroborating information on listed team members.  A name, face, title, and brief bio on the ICO website can be cobbled together easily.  Team members with long histories available on the Internet that have put in some time and effort toward polishing their global image means they are willing to stake their reputations on this project.

#### Yellow Flags:
- Imbalance in team composition.  For example, if they purport to be developing a blockchain arbitration system that could act as a sufficient substitute for existing solutions, then the project should have an overwhelming number of legal advisors and team members.  The world is already overfull with anyone who wants to take a random word or industry and but the word "blockchain" at the end of it to make money.  Hold them accountable to consulting a vast multitude of industry experts on the subject matter.

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- Contact information is available to direct inquiries to each team member personally.  This way, you can send a quick message to verify if they are even supporting the project or if the ICO just borrowed their credentials without their permission.  (Be sure to throw in a question about their history that no one else could answer for them convincingly.)

## Timeline

#### Red Flags:
- No timeline.  Not even goals.  Even the best project managers may not hit their target release dates, but all good ones at least make a plan and try to stick to it.  Optimally, they will also make announcements and adjust the timeline accordingly as they run into significant development delays, take the time to explain the root of the problem, why it couldn't be anticipated (or could have been anticipated if they had done this, that, or the other thing), and what the new plan is to stay on track so these situations can be avoided in the future.
- No milesones.  They haven't done anything and they don't report when they do.
- Unexplained labels.  It's important to offer at least some explanation of what will be accomplished.

#### Yellow Flags:
- Explaining what will be accomplished and when, but not how.
- Unrealistic expectations.  If the ICO is capped at the equivalent of 15 million USD, but the team wants to accomplish 6-8 major development projects in 6-8 months, the team will either miss their goals by a long shot or burn through their equivalent of 15 million USD well before those 6-8 goals are completed.

#### Possibly Positive Notions:
- Breaking down milestones by when, what, how, and what resources will be required/used for each milestone.  This is the level of proposal/quote detail folks are used to expecting in so many other industries (insurance, construction, etc.), so I see no reason why it can't be expected in this industry as well.  After all, your money is going toward purported "experts" who should be able to give a fairly detailed explanation off-the-cuff based on their experience.

So this is my challenge for teams cranking out ICOs and making a killing off ICOs-in-a-box: Improve the content you crank out and earn your keep.  Be a stalwart gatekeeper for potential investors and require your clients to supply quality information to the public so you feel good about putting your watermark behind the company.

Some principles to think about:
- You are responsible for your own risks.  This is a nascent and mostly unregulated industry, so your options for recourse are limited.  The best practice is to not risk more than you are willing to lose.  The next best practice is to self-insure against possible catastrophes.
- If you don't feel like you have enough information to make a good decision, pass this one up.  There will be other opportunities.

As a final note on blockchains: While I'm not a financial advisor and cannot make specific recommendations on how to valuate ICOs, I can tell you that I prefer to look at the business model to see where the funding bottlenecks and potential traps are.  I've found that in most cases, it is either
- at the gap between on-chain information and off-chain information (i.e. public reporting vs. private accounting practices at the corporate level, a la "we promise to post screenshots of our bank account balances and we're independently audited, etc.") , or
- at the gap between the main blockchain and the other piece of blockchain (i.e. layer 2 / sidechain, smart contract script, etc.)

where the decentralition of the blockchain becomes centralized at any point in the process, even if temporarily (e.g. elected relayer nodes).
