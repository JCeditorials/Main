# Utopia's Unsolved Problems

While we have many goals and interests for this website (including a certain degree of entertainment value), our main one is to allow the primary issues that keep us from achieving a utopic co-existence to bubble up to the surface for focused dialogue.

To achieve this, we would like for this website to be a place where we efficiently and effectively cover issues that have been thought through and essentially resolved so that others can quickly catch up.  This may include mythbusting through citing the results of experiments in behavioral economics or moving forward with certain assumptions while holding those assumptions at the forefront of our discussions.

Our intention is not to hold onto our philosophical progress so hard and fast that if the assumptions that create the foundation for our argumants turn out to be wrong, that we still maintain our positions despite evidence to the contrary.  In other words, we would like to avoid the "*even if* such-and-such were wrong ..." dilemma.

As hubris has it, we will no doubt fall into these traps anyway and should endeavor to correct them when called to our attention.
