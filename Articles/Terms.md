### Economy and Economics
Etymologically, economy means "household management".  
From there, the meaning eventually shifted to "trade" (exchange).  
Economy now means "wealth" as in resources.  
Early economists often confined "wealth" to goods, thereby excluding services.  
Economics is the study of production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services (wealth).  
The study of "household management" (agent level wealth distribution) would now be placed under the subcategory of microeconomics.

### Field Fit
Beginning with the broadest concept of trade/exchange, it seems appropriate to set outward bounds.  
When it comes to our discussions of economy or economics, we will limit trade/exchange to being between two or more people (not two or more robots, not two or more plants, etc.).  
As we are now endeavoring to understand a human behavior, it seems useful to draw from other disciplines that concern human behavior.  
The field that examines human behavior at the individual level is psychology.  Research here should provide support for understanding microeconomics or, more specifically, nanoeconomics (individual trades/exchanges).  
The field that examines human behavior at the aggregate level is anthropology.  Research here should provide a good foundation for understanding macroeconomics (aggregate trade/exchange trends).  

It has been my experience that macroeconomics and microeconomics have an unusually difficult time lining up with each other.  One would think, if for no other reason than simply based on their names, that these disciplines would be interrelated, interconnected, or complementary.  In asking students who chose to major in economics how these disciplines relate, most concluded that they are not all that related.  When I asked those same students which they prefer, the overwhelming response was microeconomics.  When I asked them why, they claimed that microeconomics was more scientific in that hypotheses could be tested and supported or rejected.  They further claimed that macroeconomic events were unpredictible because there were too many factors or variables involved.  This may explain why reputable economists of modern day have roughly similar predictive ability (of recessions) as meteorologists have (of major weather events).  That and the assertion(s) by 20th century economists that inductive reasoning (postulating generalizations from observations), intuition, and belief are sufficient for macroeconomic modeling.  When compared to the latest standard for sciences, macroeconomics has repeatedly earned its place among the pseudosciences.

I'm not sure how much longer our country can endure while relying so heavily on the inaccurate predictions of reputable economists and their recommendations for the direction of economic policy.  There is a call for accountability.

However, there is still hope.  In its early days, psychology was also a pseudoscience (phrenology) and was still perpetuated as such through the heyday of psychoanalysis.  Since then, results from scientific experiments have largely debunked psychoanalytical theories and psychology now takes its place among the (legitimate) sciences.

Perhaps economics could use a glue field like sociology (which happens to also struggle with its own status as a science or non-science).  Advertising agencies generate sales by harnessing the power of various causes and experiences that people identify with.  Perhaps this could be mesoeconomics.

### Logic
Mathematics is logical and appeals to people when they are rational.  Markets are irrational because people panic when things are not going well, get greedy when things are going well, and prefer steady returns.  Protecting one's resources from the forces of scarcity speaks more loudly (and biologically) than attempting to reason about future market events.

It would be useful to show that, even though people are irrational and markets are irrational by extension, people are predictably irrational and markets are predictably irrational by extension.
