# Parking Lot of Arguments (for the Sake of Argument)

### Samaritan's Dilemma

Acts of charity will
1) empower the downtrodden (i.e. offer a "hand up") or 
2) enable them (i.e. offer a "hand out") which perpetuates or exacerbates the condition

This is a problem for:
1) privately held charitable organizations (perverse incentives like the cobra/rat effect)
2) entities that receive government subsidies and other grants
3) welfare programs (allegedly creating a systemic problem of wards of the state)

- Natural/Universal/Inalienable vs. Legal/Bestowed Rights ... necessary vs. useful ... endogenous vs. exogenous ... whereby social contracts should limit its reach
- Right of Might vs. Right of Contract ... where land is conquered and protected instead of held in an exclusionary contract against all others (usufructory and adverse possession) ... but in practice is a combination where a person pays land taxes to protect the parcel from external and internal enemies with the implication that the "owner" will actually use the land (instead of simply speculating on its future value)
- Control vs. Consideration ... where one passes off some portion of control for other benefits (consideration) which forms an implied or explicit contract that, if breached, allows control to be retained instead
- Reflexivity tends toward disequilibrium (boom/bust cycles)
