# Parking Lot of Arguments (for the Sake of Argument)

### Samaritan's Dilemma

Acts of charity will
1) empower the downtrodden (i.e. offer a "hand up") or 
2) enable them (i.e. offer a "hand out") which perpetuates or exacerbates the condition

This is a problem for:
1) privately held charitable organizations (perverse incentives like the cobra/rat effect)
2) entities that receive government subsidies and other grants
3) welfare programs (allegedly creating a systemic problem of wards of the state)

Question:
1) Is there a significant difference in outcome between systemic acts of charity/kindness (e.g. welfare) and artificially randomized acts of charity/kindness (e.g. lotteries)?
2) Is there a significant difference in outcome when the rules of engagement signal entitlement compared to when the rules of engagement don't signal entitlement?
3) Does simply priming entitlement produce significantly different results?
4) Would cued awareness also minimize the various forms of the someone-else's-problem effect (e.g. bystander effect)?

### Savings Dilemma

There are two primary methods of traditional saving:
1) put cash under your mattress (or some other physical location)
2) deposit cash into a "savings" account with a commercial bank

Some advantages of the first method:
1) liquidity (ability to go directly to a vendor that accepts cash and exchange)
2) personal custody

Some disadvantages of the first method:
1) cash does not retain relative value as cost of living increases (inflation as a "natural" tax)
2) cash can be cumbersome to store (large amounts are difficult to secure and move)

Some advantages of the second method:
1) liquidity, often with limits (ability to transfer money between accounts or electronically pay bills, "free" services)
2) potentially interest-bearing (rates may or may not keep up with increases in cost of living)

Some disadvantages of the second method:
1) lock-up -- commercial banks may impose transaction limits and/or not have enough on-hand for you to withdraw during a bank run
2) lack of ability to negotiate interest rates -- which you should be able to do in theory since you are lending "your" money to the bank and they are making way more off "your" money than you are (it was never really your money, since the government owns all of the currency it mints and because depositing money into a savings account moves the government's money from your custody to the bank's custody)
3) interest income is taxed
