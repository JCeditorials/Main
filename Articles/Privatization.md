# The Case for and Against Privatization

For resources that existed prior to humanity and would presumably continue to persist absent humanity, we shall deem these "natural resources".

The power of governance lies in its ability to coordinate resources that are broadly dispersed.  Governance can range in formality from a handful of volunteers attempting to achieve a particular goal to millions of bureaucrats codifying laws to direct the behavior of billions of citizens.

For projects of a given scale, the observable tendency is for smaller scale endeavors (projects that require fewer resources) to be more efficient with fewer laborers involved and less formality while larger scale endeavores (projects that require greater resources) to be more efficient with more laborers involved and greater formality.  Attempting to apply procedures that would be a better fit for larger scale projects onto smaller scale projects tend to result in the "red tape" phenomenon, while attempting to apply procedures that would be a better fit for smaller scale projects onto larger scale projects tend to result in the "multiple hats" phenomenon.  Both misapplications tend toward waste, but for different reasons.

The tendency for the whole to be greater than the sum of its parts supports the various advantages of participating in a larger society or group as opposed to maintaining full agency as an individual.  Such advantages include, but are not limited to, division of labor, specialization, leverage, scalability, network effects, etc.

Privatization has proven itself to be useful when government cannot devote the attention something requires to spur its growth in an organized and coordinated fashion.  In recent history, the space program was very successful when the U.S. government prioritized achievement in that area during the "space race".  When the space program was unable to hold the spotlight as a priority for the country, resources shrank.  Privatizing the space program (gradually through government subsidies) reinvigorated the industry.  Air travel experienced a similar history.  This is not to say that privatization has proven itself to be optimal, nor is it to say that privatization is the better move in all cases.  (Municipalization or nationalization comes with its own advantages as well as challenges.)  This is only to say that it is not always a bad decision.

Privatization of land was particularly important during the westward expansion.  Because government didn't always have the resources to spread out and claim land in a more coordinated effort, government encouraged individual actors to go forth and conquer while it took more of a back seat and coordinated supportive efforts in the background from the east.  To claim, hold, and protect land where there was no civilization nearby to glean the benefits of neighborly society from must have taken at least some grit and tolerance for violence.  With government at a distance, citizens took law enforcement into their own hands (for better or for worse) just like any other function required for self-sufficiency and survival.
