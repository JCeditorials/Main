# Prevention Through Incentives or Punishment Through Robin-Hooding?

The question is not "How can we take back from the rich what they may have stolen from the poor?" but rather "How can we prevent any bad actor from utilizing their resources -- wherever they came from -- toward preventing others from having equal opportunity?" (the position) to choose success or failure? This is what people seem to be referring to when they protest "unfair advantages". Maintaining this clarity of focus will be important as one is never truly sure how one would decide on an issue where they have no personal experience in the matter until they come upon a situation that brings reality to the hypothetical. The financially challenged -- being ever hopeful of upward economic mobility -- is wary of setting up situations that would then put them at a disadvantage, should they at some future point ascend financially.  This psychology allows us to both idolize financially advantaged individuals -- picking role models and studying their paths to success -- and justify plots to undermine their status (or at least the status of their financially advantaged companions).

This provides a strange undercurrent for making decisions with regard to programs that assist the financially challenged.  However, we have long had examples at our disposal of ways to handle similar conflicts of interest.  When one divides the cake knowing the other must choose the piece, it is highly probable that the cake will be apportioned evenly.  The predictability of the outcome changes dramatically when the one who divides the cake is not aware in advance that the other will choose the piece.

Our nation decides what behaviors it wants to incentivize in its citizens through its laws and law enforcement, but most impactfully through its tax policies.  The comparatively minimalist federal government we enjoyed before the Civil War supported itself mostly through tariffs.  This stick discouraged the import of cheaper foreign commodities and forced our nation to find ways to be self-sufficient.  With industrialism blossoming within the country's borders, our federal government concerned itself primarily with defending against foreign nations and expanding westward.  The carrots were land ownership and finding gold.

Jared Diamond has a passage in his book titled Collapse where he establishes a rough framework for the reasons why societies fail from failure to recognize danger before it happens, failure to perceive danger even after signs are recognized, to failure to enact a successful solution due to human hubris or otherwise.

We cut our own cake, but we also make rules that don't allow us to choose the slice.  And for some reason, we don't cut the cake evenly.

Further investigation into situational psychology is necessary for building a new foundation for lasting change.
