# The New Deal Is Over 80 Years Old -- Do We Have Equitable Distribution of Wealth Yet?

One of my favorite classes in high school was AP Human Geography.  During one session, we were reading about and discussing fertility rates, birth rates, mortality rates, immigration rates, life expectancy, death rates, and replacement rates among different countries.  For a very long time, people believed that civilizations would always make enough babies that survived to reproduction age to replace themselves as well as expand the population.  In "undeveloped" countries, the replacement rate was higher because of wars, diseases, malnutrition, etc.  In "developed" countries, the replacement rate could be much lower.  But, when people got excited after coming back from a wartime victory thinking the country is a safer place to raise families, even people in developed countries made more babies.  Some of the most interesting charts are of the age and sex distribution of the total population of each country.  The legislators that enacted the "New Deal" were probably used to seeing the chart as a triangle, while we are now used to seeing onion domes or gourds.  (See PDF page [55](https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/censr-4.pdf).)  If these charts had continued to be triangle-shaped, then funding Social Security may not have been as [unsustainable](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/finrep/fr/16frusg/01112017FR_(Final).pdf) as we find it [today](https://www.census.gov/popclock/).

Was the "New Deal" a bad idea?  Probably not.  People can only make the best decisions they can make with the information they had available at the time they are/were called to make those decisions.  By the time legislators expanded the Social Security Act to implement Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, they should have already seen that a different shape was possible, as shown on the 1960 census. (See PDF page [3](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1961/compendia/statab/82ed/1961-02.pdf).)  However, there was likely quite a bit of optimism generated from the visible increase in number of minors from 1950 to 1960.  Lucky for us, the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) encompasses data as far back as 1960!  Watch as the crude birth rate drops over the course of 50 years from 1960 to 2010 by [45%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SPDYNCBRTINUSA).

High school was quite awhile ago.  These days, we have handier graphs, like the one tracking the [dependency ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?width=880&height=440&id=SPPOPDPNDOLUSA).  While this only gives a rough sketch of the overall picture (primarily because it doesn't include minors who are also dependents), it's a bit more palatable than sifting through the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data tables (which was done in this [other article](http://www.JCeditorials.pub/Articles/TheDeckIsStacked.md)) to figure out that for every ten civilians (i.e. not incarcerated and not active military), five work full time and one works part time to support all ten (i.e. the other four don't work).  Of those working, the average (income) tax rate was [21%](https://taxfoundation.org/how-much-do-people-pay-taxes/) in 2015.  For a rough apples-to-oranges comparison, if it takes five workers worth of income tax to equal one worker's income, how are we supporting the other three (and a half) people?  No wait, that's not right.  The Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax is supposed to pay for Social Security.  Cleaner accounting demands better evidence.  Maybe [this chart](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/54b02e1de4b075f5535088d5/t/5756ddb859827ef1031aece6/1465310665460/?format=1000w) will do.  It's sort of interesting to see the relationship between the "Social Insurance Taxes" line and the "Corporate Tax" line.  Here's [another chart](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/statistics/images/type_share_historical.gif) that goes back to 1934.  The methods the federal government used to source funds looked dramatically different prior to 1935 and experienced a huge overhaul over the decade that followed, after which the trajectory of each tax type seemed relatively set.  Does anyone else sense a long-con here?

While we've successfully fought to keep individual income taxes from providing over 50% of total federal revenues, and employment/payroll/FICA/social insurance taxes have [increased](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Payroll_tax_history.jpg/1920px-Payroll_tax_history.jpg) to try to make up for having less workers to pitch in, why did corporate income taxes get to decrease well into and through [national defecits](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M318501A027NBEA) amounting to steeply rising [national debt](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GFDEBTN)?

The most compelling theory seems to be that most US citizens are employees and employees only see income tax and the "employee portion" of payroll taxes reflected on their pay stub.  This might be a good example of a [pay stub](https://humanresources.umn.edu/sites/humanresources.umn.edu/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/updated_pay_statement_graphic_6-16-17.png?itok=WhEFd9Nt) due to the pay date being fairly recent.  What employees don't see is the "employer portion" of payroll taxes and corporate income taxes.  Clever employees might take their gross (pre-tax) earnings, subtract their federal taxes, and divide by the number of hours worked to get their effective pay rate during that pay period\* (before state taxes, local taxes, benefits, etc.).  What most employees don't realize is the "matching" payroll taxes their employers are required to pay on each employees' behalf also count toward this employment/payroll/FICA/social insurance taxes total.  "Rather than directly listing the ordinary taxpayersâ€™ [share](https://taxfoundation.org/what-are-payroll-taxes-and-who-pays-them/) of payments for Social Security and Medicare, half of the taxes that fund the programs are hidden from workers, in the form of lower wages."  The lucky ones might work for an employer that offers annual Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA) and thereby actually stand a chance of keeping up with inflation if the employee can't get a raise otherwise.  However, it seemed to be common practice for employers to institute "pay freezes", especially during select years of the "Great Recession", minimum wage increases, or no apparent reason (likely payroll tax increases).

(\*Keeping this calculation specific to each pay period prevents poor generalization and projection as payroll administrators make somewhat arbitrary minor adjustments from pay period to pay period, causing take-home pay to look like a moving target.)

And just in case you were under the impression that your FICA funds go toward your own retirement, that's not how this program is structured in practice.  One of the bigger criticisms of Social Security programs is unearned entitlement.  Imagine what a surprise it was for the [first person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ida_May_Fuller) who collected Social Security.  "During her lifetime she collected a total of $22,888.92 in Social Security benefits and paid in $24.75."

If we still think it's a good idea, we should look at other ways of funding it.  These ways should be significantly different than the methods we have been using.  Federal operations were primarily funded through tariffs [until 1917](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Federal_taxes_by_type.pdf).
