# The New Deal Is Over 80 Years Old -- Do We Have Equitable Distribution of Wealth Yet?

One of my favorite classes in high school was AP Human Geography.  During one session, we were reading about and discussing fertility rates, birth rates, mortality rates, immigration rates, life expectancy, death rates, and replacement rates among different countries.  For a very long time, people believed that civilizations would always make enough babies that survived to reproduction age to replace themselves as well as expand the population.  In "undeveloped" countries, the replacement rate was higher because of wars, diseases, malnutrition, etc.  In "developed" countries, the replacement rate could be much lower.  But, when people got excited after coming back from a wartime victory thinking the country is a safer place to raise families, even people in developed countries made more babies.  Some of the most interesting charts are of the age and sex distribution of the total population of each country.  The legistlators that enacted the "New Deal" were probably used to seeing the chart as a triangle, while we are now used to seeing onion domes or gourds.  (See PDF page [55](https://www.census.gov/prod/2002pubs/censr-4.pdf).)  If these charts had continued to be triangle-shaped, then funding Social Security may not have been as [unsustainable](https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/fsreports/rpt/finrep/fr/16frusg/01112017FR_(Final).pdf) as we find it [today](https://www.census.gov/popclock/).

Was the "New Deal" a bad idea?  Probably not.  People can only make the best decisions they can make with the information they had available at the time they are/were called to make those decisions.  By the time legislators expanded the Social Security Act to implement Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, they should have already seen that a different shape was possible, as shown on the 1960 census. (See PDF page [3](https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/1961/compendia/statab/82ed/1961-02.pdf).)  However, there was likely quite a bit of optimism generated from the visible increase in number of minors from 1950 to 1960.  Lucky for us, the Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED) encompasses data as far back as 1960!  Watch as the crude birth rate drops over the course of 50 years from 1960 to 2010 by [45%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SPDYNCBRTINUSA).

High school was quite awhile ago.  These days, we have handier graphs, like the one tracking the [dependency ratio](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/US_old_age_dependency_ratio.png).  It's a bit more palatable than sifting through the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data tables to figure out that for every ten civilians (i.e. not incarcerated and not active military), five work full time and one works part time to support all ten (i.e. the other four don't work).  Of those working, the average tax rate (income) was [21%](https://taxfoundation.org/how-much-do-people-pay-taxes/) in 2015.  For a rough apples-to-oranges comparison, if it takes five workers worth of income tax to equal one worker's income, how are we supporting the other three (and a half) people?

And just in case you were under the impression that your FICA funds go toward your own retirement, that's not how this program is structured in practice.  One of the bigger criticisms of Social Security programs is unearned entitlement.  Imagine what a surprise it was for the [first person](https://www.ssa.gov/history/idapayroll.html) who collected Social Security.

If we still think it's a good idea, we should look at other ways of funding it.  These ways should be significantly different than the methods we have been using.
