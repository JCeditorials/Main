# Young People Beware -- The Deck Is Stacked Against You

As I get older, I become less and less surprised at discovering how outdated the information I received during my experience in the public education system was.  As a student who wished to excel in society, maximizing the efficiency of information absorption left little room for questioning its sources.  I was keenly aware that young people who questioned the authority of teachers (who displaced the authority of parents upon entering into compulsory education) were viewed and labeled as rebels without a cause -- questioning for the sake of questioning (as those who seek to be contrary so often do) without the respect afforded to more proper philosophers.  I feel for intelligent young people who have such tremendous energy and potential but few outlets for working out the inconsistencies they pick up from the education system.  Often, they are also correct in their skepticism over offers of mentorship that may be correction programs in disguise.  After all, why work to assimilate into a system that is stacked against them?  The greatest successes go against the grain, not with.

Continue to question everything, but work toward being able to conduct inquiries with amounts of emotion proportionate to each situation's actual impact on your life.  There are very few lines of inquiry that you will encounter in your lifetime where your entire life actually depends on it, so there is no need to treat every line of inquiry as if your entire life depends on it.  This is, of course, not to encourage the practice of completely eliminating emotions from all inquiries.
